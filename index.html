Creating a gMSA (Group Managed Service Account)
1. Fired up AD lab
2. Created KDS root key
3. Created new service account with params like this:
    New-ADServiceAccount -Name gMSA1 -DNSHostName gMSA1.derp.lab -ServicePrincipalNames HTTP/gMSA1.derp.lab
4. Created group 'gmsahostgroup1' or something like that. Added test client to it.
5. Added group to service account's PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword attribute.
